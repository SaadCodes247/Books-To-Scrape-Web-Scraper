# Creating a Web Scraper for the Books to Scrape Website: https://books.toscrape.com/ 

## In this mini project, I designed a webscraper to extract the details of all 1000 books through pages 1 to 50 with the requests and BeautifulSoup Libraries. 
### The details for each book include the book_title, category, unique product id, book price, and stock availability stored in the attached csv file.
